- `POST /api/story/progress`: Update story progress
- `GET /api/story/illustrations`: Get illustrations for current story segment
- `POST /api/story/choice`: Process user story choices

#### User API
- `POST /api/user/create`: Create or retrieve user profile
- `GET /api/user/preferences`: Get user preferences
- `PUT /api/user/preferences`: Update user preferences
- `GET /api/user/progress`: Get overall user progress

#### Game API
- `GET /api/game/context`: Get context data for game iframe
- `POST /api/game/event`: Process game events
- `GET /api/game/state`: Get current game state

### Core Services

- Tracks user progress across sessions
- Manages personalization data

#### GameBridge
- Coordinates between story and game systems
- Translates story context to game parameters
- Processes game events for story integration
- Manages game state persistence

## Data Flow

### Voice Interaction Flow
1. Mobile app sends audio data to `/api/voice/recognize`
2. Server converts speech to text
3. Text and context sent to `/api/voice/respond`
4. NLP service generates appropriate response
5. Response sent to `/api/voice/synthesize`
6. Audio response returned to mobile app
7. Story state updated based on interaction

### Story Progression Flow
1. App requests current story via `/api/story/current`
2. StoryEngine generates personalized content
3. Content and illustrations sent to app
4. User interactions sent to `/api/story/progress`
5. Story state updated in database
6. New content generated based on updated state

### Game Integration Flow
1. Story reaches game trigger point
2. App requests game context via `/api/game/context`
3. Server provides context data for game iframe
4. Game events sent to `/api/game/event`
5. Server processes events and updates story state
6. Updated story content returned to app

## Implementation Considerations

### Voice Processing
- Use OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text
- Implement GPT-4 for contextual response generation
- Integrate ElevenLabs for high-quality voice synthesis
- Maintain conversation history for context awareness

### Story Generation
- Create templated story structures with personalization points
- Use GPT for dynamic content generation
- Implement content caching for performance
- Design modular story segments for flexibility

### Performance Optimization
- Implement request queuing for heavy processing tasks
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Use database indexing for fast retrieval
- Implement connection pooling

### Scalability
- Design stateless API endpoints
- Implement horizontal scaling for voice processing
- Use Redis for session and cache management
- Deploy to auto-scaling cloud infrastructure

## External Integrations
