# Voice Processing Implementation Checklist

## Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Install required packages (express, openai, elevenlabs-node, etc.)
- [ ] Configure environment variables for API keys
- [ ] Create service structure for voice processing components

## Speech-to-Text (OpenAI Whisper API)
- [ ] Create middleware for handling audio file uploads
- [ ] Implement audio preprocessing if needed
- [ ] Set up Whisper API client
- [ ] Create endpoint: `POST /api/voice/recognize`
  - [ ] Handle audio input (file upload or streaming)
  - [ ] Process through Whisper API
  - [ ] Return transcribed text
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Write tests for speech recognition functionality

## Contextual Response Generation (GPT-4)
- [ ] Set up OpenAI GPT-4 client
- [ ] Create context management service to track conversation history
- [ ] Implement prompt engineering for personalized responses
- [ ] Create endpoint: `POST /api/voice/respond`
  - [ ] Process input text with user context
  - [ ] Generate appropriate response using GPT-4
  - [ ] Return text response
- [ ] Add response filtering for appropriate content
- [ ] Implement context pruning to manage token limits
- [ ] Write tests for response generation

## Text-to-Speech (ElevenLabs)
- [ ] Set up ElevenLabs API client
- [ ] Create voice profile management
- [ ] Implement voice selection logic
- [ ] Create endpoint: `POST /api/voice/synthesize`
  - [ ] Process text input
  - [ ] Convert to audio using ElevenLabs
  - [ ] Return audio stream or file
- [ ] Add caching for common responses
- [ ] Implement streaming audio response
- [ ] Write tests for text-to-speech functionality

## Integration and Testing
- [ ] Create end-to-end voice processing pipeline tests
- [ ] Implement logging for voice processing operations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create example client implementation for testing
- [ ] Document API endpoints and parameters
