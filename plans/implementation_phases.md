# Implementation Phases

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing the Primer Server. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental development and testing.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

**Timeline: Days 1-2**

Focus on setting up the basic Express.js application structure and core infrastructure.

1. Initialize project structure and dependencies
2. Configure Express server with basic middlewares
3. Set up testing framework
4. Implement basic API structure
5. Configure environment variables
6. Create initial documentation
7. Set up linting and code style

## Phase 2: Basic Service Implementation

**Timeline: Days 3-4**

Focus on implementing the core services with basic functionality.

1. Implement basic voice processing endpoints
   - Speech-to-text processing
   - Simple response generation
   - Basic text-to-speech
2. Create in-memory state management
3. Implement simple story engine
4. Set up game generation integration with Supabase
5. Create initial user state management

## Phase 3: Integration and Enhancement

**Timeline: Days 5-6**

Focus on integrating services and enhancing functionality.

1. Integrate voice processing with story progression
2. Implement context-aware responses
3. Connect story engine with game integration
4. Enhance user state tracking
5. Implement basic personalization
6. Create end-to-end tests for main user flows

## Phase 4: Refinement and Testing

**Timeline: Day 7**

Focus on refining the implementation and comprehensive testing.

1. Implement caching for performance improvement
2. Enhance error handling and recovery
3. Create comprehensive test suites
4. Refine API responses for consistency
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Create demonstration scenarios
7. Finalize documentation

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Express Setup**: Establish the foundation with proper project structure
2. **Voice Processing**: Implement basic voice interaction flow
3. **Story Engine**: Create simple story progression mechanism
4. **Game Integration**: Set up game generation and iframe delivery
5. **User Management**: Implement basic state tracking for the demo user
6. **Integration**: Connect all components for end-to-end functionality
7. **Testing & Refinement**: Ensure reliable operation
