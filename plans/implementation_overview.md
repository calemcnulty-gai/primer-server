# The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer: Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This is an Express.js backend for "The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer" demo application. The server will handle voice processing, story generation, user state management, and game integration without authentication requirements as this is a demo app intended for a single user.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Express.js 
- **Game Generation**: Supabase Function API endpoint
- **Voice Processing**: OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text, GPT-4 for responses, ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
- **Story Engine**: GPT for dynamic content generation
- **State Management**: Server-side state storage
- **Testing**: TDD approach (write tests first, then implementation code)

## Development Philosophy
- Focus on getting a working implementation first, then improve
- Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology
- Keep state on the server side for simplicity (single-user system)

## High-Level Architecture
The server will expose several API endpoints that facilitate:
1. Voice interaction (speech-to-text, response generation, text-to-speech)
2. Story progression and state management
3. Game integration via iframe rendering
4. User state tracking

## External Services Integration
- **OpenAI**: For speech recognition and text generation
- **ElevenLabs**: For voice synthesis
- **Supabase Function**: For dynamic game generation
